{"name":"MonoEvent","tagline":"MonoEvent is a simple coroutine-based event system for programmers, by a programmer.","body":"## MonoEvent ##\r\n\r\nMonoEvent is a simple coroutine-based event system for [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) designed for programmers, by a programmer.\r\n\r\n**Latest Version: v1.0.0.0b**\r\n\r\nVersioning system \"stolen\" from ProCore (Major.Minor.Fixes):\r\n\r\nMajor is obvious -- Some giant change or addition to the project was made. Minor versions normally indicate new features or existing feature updates, and fixes are... fixes.\r\n\r\nThis was originally part of a larger project of random shit called BSGTools (BirdStreet Games Tools for short). This large package is being discontinued, and instead, its individual components will be distributed, open source, right here on GitHub. It is designed to be plug-n-play of sorts. Importing any BSGTools component .unitypackage file will import under a single BSGTools directory to keep everything nice and clean. Please note that during this update process, some documentation will be out of date until it can be updated.\r\n\r\n[BSGTools Unity Community Wiki Page](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/BSGTools)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Legal Stuff ###\r\n\r\nIf I have to clarify one thing, its this: I want the community to be able to contribute and modify what they like. I love the idea of open sourcing these sorts of things to help the community be better at what they do. However, I also want to make sure that I'm credited for all of the hard work I put into making these in the first place. That's why all of the code here will be licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License ([http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause](READ MORE ON THE LICENSE)). Basically, this means (from the previous link, edited for brevity):\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. Redistributions of source code must retain the copyright notice (not shown here), this list of conditions and the following disclaimer (not shown here).\r\n\r\n2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the copyright notice (not shown here), this list of conditions and the following disclaimer (not shown here) in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nPretty easy, right? Just don't edit the big comment at the top of each code file, or the LICENSE file located at the root of the repo. Maybe even find it in your heart to give me credit when distributing :). Otherwise, use it in your game, even if you're selling the game, I don't care.\r\n\r\n### Project Information ###\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies ####\r\nNone! InputMaster works in Unity Basic with no requirements or additional packages.\r\n\r\n#### How do I use this in my game? ###\r\nGetting started is easy peasy, just run the **.unitypackage** file located at the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n#### Where can I find tutorials? ####\r\nThere are example scenes included with all BSGTools components, this one being no exception. There are also tutorials located at the bottom of the [BSGTools Unity Community Wiki Page](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/BSGTools)!\r\n\r\n#### Contribution guidelines ####\r\nNothing too crazy here, folks. I'll check anything that is added before it is merged into the master branch, but do whatever you want otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Who do I talk to? ####\r\nOh yeah, I'm Michael. You can contact me at [michaeln@birdstreetgames.com](mailto:michaeln@birdstreetgames.com)!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
