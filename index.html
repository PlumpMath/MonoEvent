<p>MonoEvent is a simple coroutine-based event system for <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> designed for programmers, by a programmer.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Version: v1.0.0.0b</strong></p>

<p>Versioning system "stolen" from ProCore (Major.Minor.Fixes):</p>

<p>Major is obvious -- Some giant change or addition to the project was made. Minor versions normally indicate new features or existing feature updates, and fixes are... fixes.</p>

<p>This was originally part of a larger project of random shit called BSGTools (BirdStreet Games Tools for short). This large package is being discontinued, and instead, its individual components will be distributed, open source, right here on GitHub. It is designed to be plug-n-play of sorts. Importing any BSGTools component .unitypackage file will import under a single BSGTools directory to keep everything nice and clean. Please note that during this update process, some documentation will be out of date until it can be updated.</p>

<p>If I have to clarify one thing, its this: I want the community to be able to contribute and modify what they like. I love the idea of open sourcing these sorts of things to help the community be better at what they do. However, I also want to make sure that I'm credited for all of the hard work I put into making these in the first place. That's why all of the code here will be licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License (<a href="READ%20MORE%20ON%20THE%20LICENSE">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>). Basically, this means (from the previous link, edited for brevity):</p>

<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Redistributions of source code must retain the copyright notice (not shown here), this list of conditions and the following disclaimer (not shown here).</p></li>
<li><p>Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the copyright notice (not shown here), this list of conditions and the following disclaimer (not shown here) in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p></li>
</ol><p>Pretty easy, right? Just don't edit the big comment at the top of each code file, or the LICENSE file located at the root of the repo. Maybe even find it in your heart to give me credit when distributing :). Otherwise, use it in your game, even if you're selling the game, I don't care.</p>

<p>Nothing too crazy here, folks. I'll check anything that is added before it is merged into the master branch, but do whatever you want otherwise.</p>
